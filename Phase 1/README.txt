Hi! 

Thank you for taking the time to go through the readme.

Please note that I ran my code on a Mac machine, so there's a chance the code navigating the file directory might not be completely platform agnostic. Apologies!



Further,

Here are a few changes that I made to the boilerplate code provided to us - 

1. In the InsMem, open(ioDir + "/imem.txt") - Here, the path to the imem.txt has been updated

2. In the DataMem, open(ioDir + "/dmem.txt") - Here, the path to the dmem.txt has been updated


Just to have a backup, I have included an archived version of the code too in the archive folder.

Thank you!
