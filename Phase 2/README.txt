Hi!

Thank you for taking the time to go through the readme.

I modified the code to have an oDir I.e. Output directory and an IDir I.e. Input directory.

In addition, imem.txt and dmem.txt should be inside input/TestCaseFolder/ I.E. this should have the imem and dmem file. This will give you the correct output.

Thank you so much!
